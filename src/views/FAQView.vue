        answer: "No, PhantomTracker is not a real tracking system. It is a simulation designed for educational purposes only. The platform generates fictional data and does not connect to carrier databases, law enforcement systems, or any other real tracking infrastructure. Any location data, device information, or network details displayed are randomly generated or based on predefined examples.",

The IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) is a unique identifier assigned to every mobile device. In real tracking scenarios, this number would be used to identify the specific device in carrier databases. In our simulation, it serves as the input key for generating appropriate response data.",

        answer: "IMEI stands for International Mobile Equipment Identity. It's a 15-digit unique identifier assigned to every mobile device. You can typically find your device's IMEI by: 1) Dialing *#06# on your phone, 2) Checking the device settings (About Phone > Status), 3) Looking on the original packaging, or 4) Checking under the battery (on devices with removable batteries). The IMEI is used by carriers to identify devices on their network and can be used to block stolen devices.",

        id: 9,
        question: "Can someone track me using my IMEI?",
        answer: "In most cases, no. Regular individuals cannot track a device using only its IMEI. Only law enforcement agencies working with mobile carriers can potentially locate a device using its IMEI, and this requires legal authorization such as a warrant. Mobile carriers have strict privacy policies and legal requirements that prevent unauthorized tracking. Apps that claim to track devices by IMEI alone are typically scams or malware.",

        question: "Is it safe to share my IMEI number?",
        answer: "Generally, you should treat your IMEI number as sensitive information. While it alone cannot be used by most people to track your device, it could potentially be misused in combination with other information or through social engineering attacks with carrier customer service. Only share your IMEI with trusted parties such as your mobile carrier, authorized repair services, or when selling a device to provide proof of legitimacy.",

        answer: "The terminal animation is intentionally designed to simulate the time a real tracking system might take to query multiple databases, process triangulation data, and verify results.

The animation enhances the educational experience by demonstrating the complexity involved in legitimate tracking systems, which helps discourage attempts at unauthorized tracking.",

        answer: "Currently, there is no option to skip the terminal animation.

The deliberate pacing helps users understand that legitimate tracking is not instantaneous and involves multiple verification steps.
